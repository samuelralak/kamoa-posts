This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## Implementation

### Data Entry Form
Utilizing Zod and react-hook-form, the app includes forms for creating and composing new posts.

### State Management with Redux
Implemented using Redux Toolkit to manage the app's state, primarily focusing on changing the app's color scheme.

### Navigation 
The app includes 3 routes and 2 modal screens, all implemented using React Native Navigation.

### API Data Fetching and Rendering 
Fetching data from posts and comments endpoints configured in Redux Toolkit Query and rendering this data on views.
